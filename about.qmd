As a retired person with employment in the data sciences, small fruit farming occupies much of my time -- for over 30 years across the states of Alabama and Kentucky. From strawberries, blueberries, blackberries to asparagus/rhubarb and now flowers, I love to grow things and see people enjoy picking them. The farm [Fairfield Fruits](https://fairfieldfruits.com/) is located in northern Kentucky and starts the season with pick-your-own strawberries in late May.
